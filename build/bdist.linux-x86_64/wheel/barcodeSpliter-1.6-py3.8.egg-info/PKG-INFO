Description: # barcodeSpliter
        
        "barcodespliter" is a simple command-line tool that can split the mix-sampled sequencing by the barcode label, that is, demultiplex the sample. Currently at version V1.6, I have implemented this functionality most directly due to optimization issues that may require you to run more memory than the sequenced files. 
        
        TO DO LIST:
        
        1. support large sequencing files.
        2. support muti-threads
        3. add function: statistic barcode.
        
        ```
        usage: barcodeSpliter [-h] [-sr SEARCHREGION] [-o OUTFOLDER] r1.fastq.gz r2.fastq.gz barcode.csv
        
        This software can use barcode label to separate different samples in mixed-sample sequencing.
        
        positional arguments:
          r1.fastq.gz           Sequencing reads, R1. Also support uncompressed format, like: r1.fastq
          r2.fastq.gz           Sequencing reads, R2. Also support uncompressed format, like: r2.fastq
          barcode.csv           csv file contains barcode info. eg:Barcode01,TAACTCGG,TAACAGTT
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -sr SEARCHREGION, --searchRegion SEARCHREGION
                                Barcode search region.Default is 20, means the first 20nt of reads.
          -o OUTFOLDER, --outfolder OUTFOLDER
                                The name of output folder can be customized. Default: ./Output/
        ```
